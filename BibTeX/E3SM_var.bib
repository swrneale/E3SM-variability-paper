abstract = {The Community Climate System Model (CCSM) has been created to represent the principal components of the climate system and their interactions. Development and applications of the model are carried out by the U.S. climate research community, thus taking advantage of both wide intellectual participation and computing capabilities beyond those available to most individual U.S. institutions. This article outlines the history of the CCSM, its current capabilities, and plans for its future development and applications, with the goal of providing a summary useful to present and future users. The initial version of the CCSM included atmosphere and ocean general circulation models, a land surface model that was grafted onto the atmosphere model, a sea-ice model, and a "flux coupler" that facilitates information exchanges among the component models with their differing grids. This version of the model produced a successful 300-yr simulation of the current climate without artificial flux adjustments. The model was then used to perform a coupled simulation in which the atmospheric CO2 concentration increased by 1 {\%} per year. In this version of the coupled model, the ocean salinity and deep-ocean temperature slowly drifted away from observed values. A subsequent correction to the roughness length used for sea ice significantly reduced these errors. An updated version of the CCSM was used to perform three simulations of the twentieth century's climate, and several projections of the climate of the twenty-first century. The CCSM's simulation of the tropical ocean circulation has been significantly improved by reducing the background vertical diffusivity and incorporating an anisotropic horizontal viscosity tensor. The meridional resolution of the ocean model was also refined near the equator. These changes have resulted in a greatly improved simulation of both the Pacific equatorial undercurrent and the surface countercurrents. The interannual variability of the sea surface temperature in the central and eastern tropical Pacific is also more realistic in simulations with the updated model. Scientific challenges to be addressed with future versions of the CCSM include realistic simulation of the whole atmosphere, including the middle and upper atmosphere, as well as the troposphere; simulation of changes in the chemical composition of the atmosphere through the incorporation of an integrated chemistry model; inclusion of global, prognostic biogeochemical components for land, ocean, and atmosphere; simulations of past climates, including times of extensive continental glaciation as well as times with little or no ice; studies of natural climate variability on seasonal-to-centennial timescales; and investigations of anthropogenic climate change. In order to make such studies possible, work is under way to improve all components of the model. Plans call for a new version of the CCSM to be released in 2002. Planned studies with the CCSM will require much more computer power than is currently available.},

The broad nature of the spectrum is red in both zonal wavenumber and frequency. By removing an estimated background spectrum, numerous statistically significant spectral peaks are isolated. Some of the peaks correspond quite well to the dispersion relations of the equatorially trapped wave modes of shallow water theory with implied equivalent depths in the range of 12–50 m. Cross-spectrum analysis with the satellite-based microwave sounding unit deep-layer temperature data shows that these spectral peaks in the OLR are “coupled” with this dynamical field. The equivalent depths of the convectively coupled waves are shallower than those typical of equatorial waves uncoupled with convection. Such a small equivalent depth is thought to be a result of the interacti...},

abstract = {Examples of current research into systematic errors in climate models are used to demonstrate the importance of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nscale interactions on diurnal,intraseasonal and seasonal timescales for the mean and variability of the tropical climate system. It has enabled some conclusions to be drawn about possible processes that may need to be$\backslash$r$\backslash$nrepresented, and some recommendations to be made regarding model improvements. It has been shown that the Maritime Continent heat source is a major driver of the global circulation but yet is poorly represented in GCMs. A new climatology of the diurnal cycle has been used to provide compelling evidence of important land-sea breeze and gravity wave effects, which may play a crucial role in the heat and moisture budget of this key region for the tropical and global circulation. The role of the diurnal cycle has also been emphasized for intraseasonal variability associated with the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO). It is suggested that the diurnal cycle in Sea$\backslash$r$\backslash$nSurface Temperature (SST) during the suppressed phase of the MJO leads to a triggering of cumulus congestus$\backslash$r$\backslash$nclouds, which serve to moisten the free troposphere and hence precondition the atmosphere for the next active$\backslash$r$\backslash$nphase. It has been further shown that coupling between the ocean and atmosphere on intraseasonal timescales$\backslash$r$\backslash$nleads to a more realistic simulation of the MJO. These results stress the need for models to be able to simulate firstly, the observed tri-modal distribution of convection, and secondly, the coupling between the ocean and atmosphere on diurnal to intraseasonal timescales. It is argued, however, that the current representation of the ocean mixed layer in coupled models is not adequate to represent the complex structure of the observed mixed layer, in particular the formation of salinity barrier layers which can potentially provide much stronger local coupling between the atmosphere and ocean on diurnal to intraseasonal timescales.},

abstract = {This paper documents coupled simulations of two developmental versions of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) towards CAM6. The configuration called CAM5.4 introduces new microphysics, aerosol, and ice nucleation changes, among others to CAM. The CAM5.5 configuration represents a more radical departure, as it uses an assumed probability density function (PDF)-based unified cloud parameterization to replace the turbulence, shallow convection, and warm cloud macrophysics in CAM. This assumed PDF method has been widely used in the last decade in atmosphere-only climate simulations but has never been documented in coupled mode. Here, we compare the simulated coupled climates of CAM5.4 and CAM5.5 and compare them to the control coupled simulation produced by CAM5.3. We find that CAM5.5 has lower cloud forcing biases when compared to the control simulations. Improvements are also seen in the simulated amplitude of the Ni{\~{n}}o-3.4 index, an improved representation of the diurnal cycle of precipitation, subtropical surface wind stresses, and double Intertropical Convergence Zone biases. Degradations are seen in Amazon precipitation as well as slightly colder sea surface temperatures and thinner Arctic sea ice. Simulation of the 20th century results in a credible simulation that ends slightly colder than the control coupled simulation. The authors find this is due to aerosol indirect effects that are slightly stronger in the new version of the model and propose a solution to ameliorate this. Overall, in these early coupled simulations, CAM5.5 produces a credible climate that is appropriate for science applications and is ready for integration into the National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR's) next-generation climate model.},

These process-oriented diagnostics are intended to provide insights into how parameterizations of physical processes in climate models should be improved for a better MJO simulation. This paper proposes one such process-oriented diagnostic, which is designed to represent sensitivity of simulated convection to environmental moisture: composites of a relative humidity (RH) profile based on precipitation percentiles. The ability of the RH composite diagnostic to represent the diversity of MJO simulation skill is demonstrated using a group of climate model simulations participating in phases 3 and 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5). A set of scalar process metrics that captures the key physical attributes of the RH diagnostic is derived and their statistical relationship with indices that quantify the fidelity of the MJO simulation is tested. It is found that a process metric that represents the amount of lower-tropospheric humidity increase required for a transition from weak to strong rain regimes has a robust statistical relationship with MJO simulation skill. The results herein suggest that moisture sensitivity of convection is closely related to a GCM?s ability to simulate the MJO.},

abstract = {Abstract The influence of the MJO on the phase and amplitude of the diurnal cycle of rainfall during Australian summer [December?February (DJF)] over the Maritime Continent (MC) and northern Australia is investigated using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 and 3G68 datasets. The gridded rainfall was partitioned into MJO categories (active, suppressed, and weak) based on their longitudinal position and by utilizing the real-time multivariate MJO (RMM) index of Wheeler and Hendon. The diurnal cycles were composited and an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was applied to extract the spatial and temporal variability. Distinct variations in the rainfall distribution pattern among categories of the MJO over land and ocean are seen. The result of the composite-mean rainfall distribution shows that the average daily rainfall rate over islands is higher during suppressed MJO days, while for surrounding oceans and northern regions of Australia, more rainfall occurs during MJO active days. The normalized relative amplitude (NRA) of the diurnal cycle of rainfall shows that morning rainfall near coastal areas during active days of the MJO is 1.5 times greater than the climatological-mean rainfall but is less than or equal to the climatological mean during other phases of the MJO. Similarly, during the suppressed phase of the MJO evening rainfall is greater over the islands than in other MJO phases. The first two modes of the EOF alone explain more than 88{\%} (65{\%}) of the variance for the 3B42 (3G68) rainfall, and the corresponding principal component time series show a marked diurnal cycle. The results show that both the amplitude and phase of the diurnal cycle of rainfall are modulated by the categories of the MJO. In general, the peak in the diurnal cycle for active (suppressed/weak) days of the MJO lags (leads) the peak in the diurnal cycle for total rainfall by 2 h. Over Darwin and its adjacent regions, the active phase of the MJO is responsible for the occurrence of maximum rainfall after midnight, which is unusual in this region.},

Consequently, more available potential energy is generated and the intraseasonal variability (ISV) becomes stronger. The organization of ISV is also improved, which is manifest in coherent structures between different MJO phases and an improved simulation of the eastward propagation of MJOs with a reasonable eastward speed. The improved propagation can be attributed to a better simulation of the low-level zonal winds due to the inclusion of CMT. The authors posit that the large-scale zonal winds are akin to a selective conveyor belt that facilitates the organization of ISVs into highly coherent structures, which are important features of observed MJOs. The conclusions are supported by two supplementary experiments, which include the dilute plume approximation and CMT separately. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {The ability of eight climate models to simulate the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) is examined using diagnostics developed by the U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) MJO Working Group. Although the MJO signal has been extracted throughout the annual cycle, this study focuses on the boreal winter (November–April) behavior. Initially, maps of the mean state and variance and equatorial space–time spectra of 850-hPa zonal wind and precipitation are compared with observations. Models best represent the intraseasonal space–time spectral peak in the zonal wind compared to that of precipitation. Using the phase– space representation of the multivariate principal components (PCs), the life cycle properties of the simulated MJOs are extracted, including the ability to represent how the MJO evolves from a given subphase and the associated decay time scales.Onaverage, theMJOdecay (e-folding) time scale for all models is shorter (;20– 29 days) than observations (;31 days). All models are able to produce a leading pair of multivariate principal components that represents eastward propagation of intraseasonal wind and precipitation anomalies, al- though the fraction of the variance is smaller than observed for all models. In some cases, the dominant time scale of these PCs is outside of the 30–80-day band. Several key variables associated with the model's MJO are investigated, including the surface latent heat flux, boundary layer (925 hPa) moisture convergence, and the vertical structure of moisture. Low-level moisture convergence ahead (east) of convection is associated with eastward propagation in most of the models.Afew models are also able to simulate the gradual moistening of the lower troposphere that precedes observed MJO convection, as well as the observed geographical difference in the vertical structure of moisture associated with the MJO. The dependence of rainfall on lower tropospheric relative humidity and the fraction of rainfall that is stratiform are also discussed, including implications these diagnostics have for MJO simulation. Based on having the most realistic intraseasonal multivariate empirical orthogonal func- tions, principal component power spectra, equatorial eastward propagating outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), latent heat flux, low-level moisture convergence signals, and vertical structure of moisture over the Eastern Hemisphere, the superparameterizedCommunity Atmosphere Model (SPCAM)and theECHAM4/ Ocean Isopycnal Model (OPYC) show the best skill at representing the MJO.},

abstract = {The extratropical influence is an important mechanism in the initiation$\backslash$nof the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Based on analyses of several$\backslash$ndatasets, this article demonstrates that the MJO case initiated in$\backslash$nlate January 2008 was strengthened by a preceding cold surge over$\backslash$nWest Asia when the MJO was at its initiation phase. The cold surge-related$\backslash$nnortherlies propagated southward along the east coast of Africa.$\backslash$nThe associated convergence on the edge of the surge enhanced ascending$\backslash$nmotion in the tropical western Indian Ocean and led to the onset$\backslash$nof deep convection to the north of Madagascar. This process helped$\backslash$nto amplify the MJO convection rapidly, as shown in the development$\backslash$nof the moist static energy anomalies. In this way, the cold surge$\backslash$naffected the behaviour of the MJO and modified the timing of its$\backslash$ninitiation to some extent. These results support previous studies$\backslash$nthat extratropical factors are important for the initiation of the$\backslash$nMJO, and suggest that the subtropical cold surges are likely to strengthen$\backslash$nand accelerate the build-up of deep MJO convection at the MJO initiation$\backslash$nphase.},

The twentieth century CCSM4 run is compared with the warmest twenty-first century projection (representative concentration pathway 8.5, or RCP8.5). The last 20 years of each simulation are compared in their MJO character- istics, including spatial variance distributions of winds, precipitation and outgoing longwave radiation, histograms of event amplitude, phase and duration, and composite maps of phases. The RCP8.5 run exhibits increased vari- ance in intraseasonal precipitation, larger-amplitude MJO events, stronger MJO rainfall in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, and a greater frequency of MJO occurrence for phases corresponding to enhanced rainfall in the Indian Ocean sector. These features are consistent with the con- cept of an increased magnitude for the hydrological cycle under greenhouse warming conditions. Conversely, the number of active MJO days decreases and fewer weak MJO events occur in the future climate state. These results motivate further study of these changes since tropical rainfall variability plays such an important role in the region's socio-economic well being. Keywords},

abstract = {Precipitation is an important climate quantity that is critically relevant to society. In spite of intense efforts, significant precipitation biases remain in most climate models. One pervasive and persistent bias found in many general circulation models occurs in the Tropical West Pacific where northern hemisphere summer-time precipitation is often underestimated compared to observations. Using the DOE-E3SM model, the inclusion of a missing process, convective gustiness, is shown to reduce those biases through a net increase in surface evaporation. Gustiness in surface wind fields is assumed to arise empirically in proportion to the intensity of convective precipitation. The increased evaporation can be treated as an increase in the moist static energy forcing into the atmosphere. A Normalized Gross Moist Stability (NGMS) framework (which characterizes the relationship between convective forcing and convective response) is used to explore the processes responsible for the precipitation bias, and the impact of the gustiness parameterization in reducing that bias. Because the NGMS of the Tropical West Pacific is less than unity in the E3SMv1 model, the increase in energy forcing amplifies the increase in precipitation to exceed that of the evaporative flux. Convective gustiness favors increased precipitation in regions where the resolved surface winds are weak and convection is present. },

abstract = {Simulations of the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon and tropical Atlantic climate variability in the newest version of the Community Climate System Model [version 3 (CCSM3)] are examined in comparison with observations and previous versions of the model. The analyses are based upon multicentury control integrations of CCSM3 at two different horizontal resolutions (T42 and T85) under present-day CO 2 concentrations. Complementary uncoupled integrations with the atmosphere and ocean component models forced by observed time-varying boundary conditions allow an assessment of the impact of air-sea coupling upon the simulated characteristics of ENSO and tropical Atlantic variability. The amplitude and zonal extent of equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature variability associated with ENSO is well simulated in CCSM3 at both resolutions and represents an improvement relative to previous versions of the model. However, the period of ENSO remains too short (2-2.5 yr in CCSM3 compared to 2.5-8 yr in observations), and the sea surface temperature, wind stress, precipitation, and thermocline depth responses are too narrowly confined about the equator. The latter shortcoming is partially overcome in the atmosphere-only and ocean-only simulations, indicating that coupling between the two model components is a contributing cause. The relationships among sea surface temperature, thermocline depth, and zonal wind stress anomalies are consistent with the delayed/recharge oscillator paradigms for ENSO. We speculate that the overly narrow meridional scale of CCSM3's ENSO simulation may contribute to its excessively high frequency. The amplitude and spatial pattern of the extratropical atmospheric circulation response to ENSO is generally well simulated in the T85 version of CCSM3, with realistic impacts upon surface air temperature and precipitation; the simulation is not as good at T42. CCSM3's simulation of interannual climate variability in the tropical Atlantic sector, including variability intrinsic to the basin and that associated with the remote influence of ENSO, exhibits similarities and differences with observations. Specifically, the observed counterpart of El Ni{\~{n}}o in the equatorial Atlantic is absent from the coupled model at both horizontal resolutions (as it was in earlier versions of the coupled model), but there are realistic (although weaker than observed) SST anomalies in the northern and southern tropical Atlantic that affect the position of the local intertropical convergence zone, and the remote influence of ENSO is similar in strength to observations, although the spatial pattern is somewhat different.},

Existing algorithms designed to deal with piecewise planar surfaces with distinct features and Lambertian reflectance do not apply in applications such as 3D reconstruction of medical images including stereo retinal images. In this paper, robust pixel feature vectors are formulated to extract discriminative features in the presence of noise in scale space, through which the response of low-frequency mechanisms alter and interact with the response of high-frequency mechanisms. The deep structures of the scene are represented with the evolution of disparity estimates in scale space, which distributes the matching ambiguity along the scale dimension to obtain globally coherent reconstructions. The performance is verified both qualitatively by face validity and quantitatively on our collection of stereo fundus image sets with ground truth, which have been made publicly available as an extension of standard test images for performance evaluation.},

Negative intraseasonal outgoing longwave radiation, indicating deep convective clouds, is in phase with increased surface wind stress, decreased solar heating, and increased surface turbulent heat flux—mostly evaporation—from the ocean to the atmosphere. Net heat flux cools the upper ocean in the convective phase. Sea surface temperature (SST) warms during the suppressed phase, reaching a maximum before the onset of MJO convection. The timing of convection, surface flux, and SST is consistent from the central Indian Ocean (70°E) to the western Pacific Ocean (160°E).Mean surface evaporation observed in TOGA COARE and DYNAMO (110 W m−2) accounts for about half of the moisture supply for the ...},

Deep convection parameterization changes include a dilute plume calculation of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the introduction of convective momentum transport (CMT). An additional cloud fraction calculation is now performed following macrophysical state updates to provide improved thermodynamic consistency. A freeze-drying modification is further made to the cloud fraction calculation in very dry environments (e.g., the Arctic), where cloud fraction and cloud water values were often inconsistent in CAM3. In CAM4 the FV dynamical core further degrades the excessive trade-wind simulation, but reduces zonal stress errors at higher latitudes.

@article{Krishnamurti1988,
abstract = {Abstract In this Paper we have examined the fluxes of latent and sensible heat between the ocean and the atmosphere utilizing primarily the observations from the global experiment. The procedure for calculation is based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The transfer coefficients are stability dependent. Some calculations are also performed utilizing several different datasets. One of these covers the region of Asian monsoon oceans during the Global Experiment. This is a daily sea surface temperature (SST) dataset. A second dataset covers the global oceans for the entire FGGE year. This is a 10-day averaged dataset prepared by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts. A third dataset obtained from the Japan Meteorological Agency, covers a 7-year period between 1979 and 1985. This dataset was also averaged over 10-day periods. Both the daily and the 10-day averaged SST data have been used for studies of low frequency oscillations. An equivalence, on the time scale of 30 to 50 days, for the oscillations of these two datasets is demonstrated. The global distribution of SST oscillations on this time scale are explored. The region of pronounced variance in the SST oscillation lies over the equatorial western Pacific Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. Calculations of air-sea energy fluxes include (i) the total contribution, (ii) those contributed on the time scale of 30 to 50 days, and (iii) those obtained by suppressing oscillations for one or more of the variables on this time scale. The main results of these computations show that SST oscillations with an amplitude of 0.3° to 1.0°C occur on this time scale over the tropical oceans. The fluxes of latent and sensible heat on this lime scale over the tropics have mean amplitudes of the order of 30 and 3 W m−2, respectively. The typical mean total fluxes in these regions are of the order of 200 and 30 W m−2 respectively. The fluctuations in the wind speed and the sea surface temperatures control the heat and moisture fluxes on the time scale of 30 to 50 days. Fluctuations of surface air temperature and surface humidity do not seem to be important over most oceans. Among these variables the role of the wind oscillations is somewhat larger. Proposals for further studies towards the understanding of oscillations on this time scale are presented.},

abstract = {Abstract. By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850–near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: {\&}ndash; How does the Earth system respond to forcing? {\&}ndash; What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? {\&}ndash; How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},
